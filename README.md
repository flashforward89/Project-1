# Project-1

Our project is to uncover patterns in criminal activity around Texas with the weather over the 4 quaters of the year covering data between 2009 to 2019. We'll examine relationships between types of crime and local temperature; crime rates and rainfall; trends in crime rates over the course of the year; and related questions, as the data admits.
